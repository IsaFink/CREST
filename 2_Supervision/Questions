I have energy paths that are increasing all the way. Should I exclude these from the data treatment?
 --> examples are in Verapamil: 98, 100, 111, 117, 
    My solution: if max value is within the last 2 points, then I exclude it.
 Other solution: Could just remove the last two points of the paths, if the new last two points are still a problem, then exclude completely. Check one of the crazy ones using VMD to see if it's just the last trajectory that's fucked due to high energy state. 
    further work: RMSDs and criteria for them - but add it to the dictionary

Will we have all data twice as there are to plots pr. sim?

I need to delete the xtb output with lowest numbers in each of my folders
#Tomorrowproblem

Is caffeine too small not to have only a dihydrogen fall off?
#the pronlem is probably the determine bonds - ask David
Possible solution:
    As we don't use the charges in order to find the mZ peaks, should I remove that part?
    --> Then we will have less errors for caffeine at least --> more peaks.
Solution:
    --> #Add a check-in that makes sure the charge of the mmolecule is != 0.
    #zero --> error
    #Else, just print charge.



What package can I use to create the gifs? I might as well do it and it sounds fun and can be used for error looking.
rdkit - load in the xtb_path files for each of the  sims and thn save each trajectory as a picture - add them all together into a gif. 


Energy paths - in one picture - normalize x-axis from 0-1. The same products but the different paths
Also a plot with all energy paths in order to see if any are causing issues (just to visualize the issues)

Plotting 
CE --> 1/CE 
rate constant --> log(rate )
'Prob_contrib' is probably  the best one. 

Doing 2 plots stacked - one observed and one with experimental values. 
 --> also no problem with the scale 

Visualize workflow. 
Lots of pretty pictures - something protonated.

The beginning of the project:
    metabolites from the drug+bacteria incubated.
    WE theoretically get the intensity distributions of fragments. 

    Already a tool that predicts possible metabolites from drug
    - we get mass of the metabolites

    apply workflow to f.ex two metabolites of same mass, using it to distinguish between them based on their intensity peaks. 
    The metabolites are also run through tandem MS experimentally, but atm we can't distinguish between them.
    Classical examples: hydroxylation of anything :)
                        Vitamin B2 - hydroxylation happens on random aromatic positions. 
                        diazepan --> oxidized either to 4'-hydroxydiazepan or themazepan (other position to be determined)
    Metabolites can have different toxicities.
    Caffeine metabolites --> Show metabolites and compare to my computed results.
